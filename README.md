<h1>Bad USB - Raspberry Pi Pico</h1>


<h2>Description</h2>
Transforming a Raspberry Pi Pico into a "Bad USB" (Inspired from Hak5's RubberDucky) This is done by the Pi pretending to be a Human Interface Device(HID) such as a keyboard. The Bad Usb can type at 1,000+ WPM and can be used to bruteforce passwords and execute various payloads that can be as funny as a Rick Roll or as dangerous as a password cracker.
